  - title: Simplix/Theme
    details: A unified design-token system containing colors, roles, typography scales, spacing, and elevations — the single source of visual consistency used by both UI components and custom user components.

  - title: Simplix/Headless
    details: Interaction and state logic extracted into framework-agnostic controllers and hooks; this layer defines how components behave (focus, click, toggles, patterns) without dictating how they look.
